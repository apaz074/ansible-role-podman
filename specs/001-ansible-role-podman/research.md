# Research & Best Practices

## Phase 0 Research Summary

### Decision: Multi-OS Compatibility Strategy
- **Rationale**: Based on Ansible best practices, compatibility across Debian, RHEL, and Arch Linux families will be handled using the `ansible_os_family` fact. This allows for conditional logic. Variable differences (like package names) will be managed in dedicated files within the `vars/` directory (e.g., `vars/Debian.yml`, `vars/RedHat.yml`), which are loaded conditionally by the main tasks file.
- **Alternatives considered**: A single large task file with many `when` conditions was rejected as it is less maintainable and harder to read.

### Decision: Testing Strategy
- **Rationale**: The project will use Molecule with the `ansible` driver to orchestrate Podman containers. This `ansible-native` approach provides full control over the test environment using standard Ansible playbooks for container creation and destruction, as outlined in the project constitution. This is a well-established pattern for testing Ansible roles.
- **Alternatives considered**: Using the `molecule-podman` driver was an option, but the `ansible` driver offers more explicit control via playbooks, which aligns better with the constitution's principles.

### Decision: Deferred Clarifications
- **Scale/Scope**: The question of deployment scale (tens vs. thousands of servers) is deferred. The core role logic remains the same regardless of scale. Performance at high scale is a deployment concern (e.g., relates to Ansible controller tuning) rather than a role implementation detail. The current focus is on correctness and idempotency.
